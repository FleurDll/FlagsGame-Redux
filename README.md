# Flags Game

_25/03/21_

## https://flags-game-fd.netlify.app

This game tests our knowledge of flags of the world. We can choose different modes to train according to our level. <br>
Here are the features of the game :

- Region (world, europe, americas, africa, asia, oceania)
- Number of levels (10, 20, 50 etc)
- Score
- Indication on whether you have the correct answer or not
- At the end of the game, you can see what went wrong
- A timer, to see how long it took you
- Login with Google so your scores are registered
- Compare your score with the other players at the score page
- Some sounds (button click, win, lose, ...)

## Motivation

I love to memorize where each country is located and what are their flags. <br>
So I thought, wouldn't it be cool to create my own app where I could train myself on? <br>
It was above all a good way to challenge myself with React and Redux.<br>

## API

From [Rest Countries](https://restcountries.eu/#rest-countries-stay-up-to-date) <br>
I filtered the image sources of flags, the name of the countries and their region.

## Future improvement

I intend to add the time taken in the scores page. <br>
And also a way to reward with points the players who had a good score in a short amount of time.
