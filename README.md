This game test our knowledge of flags of the world. We can choose different modes to train the best according to our level. <br>
Here are the features of the game :

- Region (world, europe, americas, africa, asia, oceania)
- Number of levels (10, 20, 50 etc)
- Score
- Indication on whether you have the correct answer or not
- At the end of the game, you can see where you went wrong
- A timer, to see how long it took you
- Login with Google so your scores are registered
- Compare your score with the other players at the scores page
- Some sounds (button click, win, lose, ...)

## Motivation

I love to memorize where each country is located and what are their flags. <br>
So I thought, wouldn't it be cool to create my own app where I could train myself on? <br>
It was above all a good way to challenge myself for my first React and Redux app.<br>
